- Using any of the tools you've worked with so far, create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game grid using your HTML element of choice.
- When a cell in the grid is clicked, an X or O should appear in that spot depending on whose turn it is.
- A heading should say whether it is X's or O's turn and change with each move made.
- A button should be available to clear the grid and restart the game.
- When a player has won, or the board is full and the game results in a draw, a Bootstrap alert or similar - Bootstrap component should appear across the screen announcing the winner.
